# RISC-V Single Cycle RV32I core

This is a Single Cycle processor running the RV32I implementation, hence a 32-bits cpu, written in Verilog.

# Introduction

In the rapidly advancing field of processor architecture, the RISC-V instruction set has become a significant player, offering an open-source, scalable, and modular alternative. This project aims to explore and implement a RISC-V single-cycle processor, designed with a focus on simplicity and efficiency.

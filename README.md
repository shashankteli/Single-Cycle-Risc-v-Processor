# RISC-V Single Cycle RV32I core

This is a Single Cycle processor running the RV32I implementation, hence a 32-bits cpu, written in Verilog.

# Introduction

In the rapidly advancing field of processor architecture, the RISC-V instruction set has become a significant player, offering an open-source, scalable, and modular alternative. This project aims to explore and implement a RISC-V single-cycle processor, designed with a focus on simplicity and efficiency.

# Objectives

The main objective of this project is to design and implement a RISC-V single-cycle processor. By utilizing the principles of simplicity and modularity that RISC-V is known for, the processor is intended to execute a broad set of instructions within a single clock cycle. Additionally, the project employs rigorous validation processes using open-source tools to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the processor design.

# Project Scope

The scope of this project goes beyond traditional processor design. It involves creating a RISC-V single-cycle processor, carefully selecting a set of instructions to maximize performance, and applying thorough verification techniques. By combining the robust architecture of RISC-V with comprehensive validation methods, this project aims to contribute to the evolution of processor architectures and verification standards.
